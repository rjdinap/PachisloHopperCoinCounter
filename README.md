Simple Pachislo hopper coin counter

Preface:

I needed to count several thousand quarters in stacks of 40 for rolling in coin sleeves. I know coin counters are cheap these days. You can pick up a Vevor or comparible cheap unit for around $60. And they will even sort the coins for you. However, I couldn't really justify buying a coin counter when I'm probably only going to need it 1 time in my life.

Enter a hopper from a Japanese Pachislo machine,  an Arduino, and about 2 hours time, and I have a one time use coin counter.


Build has very minimal components and should only take you about 15 minutes to wire up if you are using the same hopper I have (Juki JSH777). Otherwise you'll need to prod the connections on the whichever brand hopper you have.


Press the switch, and the hopper motor will activate. It will stop when it has reached the proper number of coins, or after 3 seconds of not detecting a coin ejected (hopper empty?)
